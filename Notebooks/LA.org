* Lecture Notes
** High Order Derivatives
*** Notes
Taking second and third derivatives and more!
*Remember*:
 - First function is a /position/ function
 - First derivative is the /velocity/ function
 - Second Derivative is the /acceleration/ function

*** Work Applications of higher order derivatives
- A function, f, measures something
- Its derivative, f' measures the rate of change of something
- Its second deerivative f'', measures the rate of change of the rate of change.

*** Anti-derivatives
Anti derivatives of higher order derivatives generate an unknwon constant which cannot be determined without an initial condition
