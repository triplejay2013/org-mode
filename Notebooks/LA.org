*** Lecture Notes
**** High Order Derivatives
***** Notes
  Taking second and third derivatives and more!
  *Remember*:
   - First function is a /position/ function
   - First derivative is the /velocity/ function
   - Second Derivative is the /acceleration/ function

***** Work Applications of higher order derivatives
  - A function, f, measures something
  - Its derivative, f' measures the rate of change of something
  - Its second deerivative f'', measures the rate of change of the rate of change.

***** Anti-derivatives
  Anti derivatives of higher order derivatives generate an unknwon constant which cannot be determined without an initial condition

**** Abstract Functions Functions
	 - example
x(t)^2 + y(t)^2 

(think of chain rule)
outside is u^2 -> Derivative is 2u
inside is x(t) -> Derivative is dx/dt

df/dt = 2x dx/dt + 2y dy/dt

**** Optimization
	 - Objective Function - What is being optimized?
	   - Maximum
	   - Minimum
	   - Any superlative
*** Examples

#+NAME: Steve's Problem
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE 
Steve has 60 feet of fencing to build a rectangular dog kennel.
An existing fence will serve as one side of the kennel. If steve
wants to build the largest kennel possible using only the material he has,
what dimensions shoudl he use?

Objective Function: Area of kennel
	A=xy
Constraint: 60 feet of fencing
	60=2x+y => 60-2x=y

A(x)=xy
A(x)=x(60-2x)=60x-2x^2
A'(x)=60-4x
60-4x=0; x=15
