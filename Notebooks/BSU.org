***** Notes
****** Key Generation
Key Generation
 1. Choose two primes p,q and compute:
    n=p*q
    phi(n)=(p-1)*(q-1)
 2. Choose a 'random' number t such taht gcd(x,phi(n))=1
 3. Compute e=t^-1 mod phi(n)
	
Public Key:		(n,e)
Private Key:	(t, phi(n))

*RSA ENCRYPTION*
E=M^e mod n
E=ciphertext of M

*RSA DECRYPTION*
M=E^t mod n

*MISC*
e=t^{-1} mod phi(n)
t=e^{-1} mod phi(n)
e is public
phi(n) is private

*FACTORING PROBLEM*
Given n that is a product of two primes, find its primes
****** Attacks
******* COMMON MODULUS ATTACK
Suppose that same message M < n is sent to two different parties whose
encryption exponents respectiveily are e_1 and e_2 and suppose that gcd(e1,e2)=1

 - Assume gcd(e1,e2) = 1
 - gcd(a,b) = a*x + b*y
   for some x,y belonging to Z
 - Using the extendid Euclidean algorithm one can find x and y such that:
   1 = gcd(e1,e2)=e_1 * x + e_2 * y
 - The original message can be found by:
   E^x * F^y mod n 
   = ((M^{e_1} mod n)^x * (M^{e_2} mod n)^y) mod n
   = (M^{e_1})^x * (M^{e_2})^y mod n
   = M^{e_1 * x + e_2 * y} mod n 
   = M^1 mod n 
   = M

| Alice    | Bob      |
|----------+----------|
| n_1, e_1 | n_2, e_2 |
| t_1      | t_2      |

The encrypted messages are: 
E=M^{e_1} mod n  	(Alice)
 and 
F=M^{e_2} mod n		(Bob)

******* COMMON ENCRYPTION EXPONENT
/assume same people and messages as above/
Assume that gcd(n_1,n_2)=1
Plaintext:	M < n1,n2
E_1=M^e mod n_1	(Alice)
E_2=M^e mod n_2	(Bob)

Using CRT we can solve 
	E_1=M^e mod n_1	
	E_2=M^e mod n_2	
 for M.
 
 M is the unique solution of 
	E_1=M^e mod n_1	
	E_2=M^e mod n_2	
 modulo n1*n2
 	M mod n1*n2 = M because M <n1,n2

	*CHINESE REMAINDER THEOREM (CRT)*
	let n1, n2, ... , nk be natural numbers such that for i,j distinct incices one
	has gcd(ni,nj)=1

	then the system of linear congruences has a solution which is unique modulo:
		N=n1*n2*..*nk
		
    Solution: x=b1*N1*x1 + b2*N2*x2+...+bk*Nk*xk mod N
    where Ni=N/ni and xi=(1/Ni) mod ni
******* COMMON MODULUS ATTACK (Directory Attack?)

| Alice    | Bob      |
|----------+----------|
| n_1, e_1 | n_2, e_2 |
| t_1      | t_2      |

n1 != n2

If gcd(n1,n2) = d > 1
	this means that n1 and n2 share more than 1 factor (other than 1|N)
	then d is one of the primes of n1 *and* n2
******* DOUBLE DUTY ATTACK
		- Assume that /Alice/ uses the same RSA key for encryption AND signature
		- Knowing the same key is used for encryption and signature, we can decrypt the ciphertext E
		  1. Choose a random number /b/
		  2. Compute ~x=b^e * E mod n~
		  3. request /Alice? to sign x
		  4. Let /y/ be the signature on /x/. Compute ~y/b mod n~
		  5. claim y/b mod n = M

Proof of claim (5)
REMEMBER:
~e=t^-1 mod phi(n)~
~e*t = t*t^-1 mod phi(n)~
~e*t = 1 mod phi(n)~
~e*t mod phi(n) = 1~

~y/b mod n = (x^t)/b mod n~
		  ~= (b^e * E)/b mod n~
		  ~= ((b^{e*t})/b) * E^t mod n~
		  ~= ((b^{e*t mod phi(n))}/b) * E^t mod n~
		  see REMEMBER above
		  ~= (b^1)/b * E^t mod n~
		  ~= 1 * E^t mod n~
		  ~= E^t mod n = M~
******* Chosen Ciphertext Attack(Signature Forging)
		- This attack can be used to forge a signature on a message
******** M-coded message
		- Compute factorization of:
		M= p1^{m1} * p2^{m2}*...*pk^{mk}
		- Requests that bob sign p1,p2,p3,....,pk
		- Assume that Q1,Q2,Q3,...,Qk are corresponding signatures..
		CLAIM: Q1^{m1}*Q2^{m2}*....*Qk^{mk} is Bob's signature on M

		(n,e) - Bob's public signature key
		Q1=P1^t mod n (Q1 is a signature on p1)
		Q2=p2^t mod n
		.
		.
		.
		Qk=pk^t mod n : where t is Bob's private signature key

******** RSA verification:
			____SIGNATURE_____
		(Q1^{m1}*Q2^{m2}*....*Qk^{mk})^e mod n = M
		(Q1^{m1})^e *(Q2^{m2})^e *....* (Qk^{mk})^e mod n = M
		((P1^t mod n)^{m1*e}) *((P2^t mod n)^{m2*e}) *....* ((pk^t mod n){mk*e}) mod n = M
		(p1^{t*e})^m1 * (p2^{t*e}})^m2 *...* (pk^{t*e})^mk mod n
		REMEMBER: t=e^-1 mod phi(n) --> t*e= 1 mod phi(n)
		(p1^{t*e mod phi(n)})^m1 * (p2^{t*e mod phi(n)}})^m2 *...* (pk^{t*e mod phi(n)})^mk mod n
		(p1^1)^m1 * (p2^1)^m2 * ... * (pk^1)^mk = M
		^
		This shows that Q1^m1 * Q2^m2 *....*Qk^mk is a valid signature on M
#+NAME: CipherText worked out
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE 
#+END_EXAMPLE
******** Example
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE 
M=12=2^2 * 3
Bob's public signature key (n=15,e=7)

15=3*5, phi(15)=(3-1)(5-1)=12
t=7
e= t^-1 mod 8
e= 7^-1 mod 8
e=7

1. We will show how Eve can forge Bob's signature on M=12
2. Eve asks Bob to sign p1=2 and p2=3
3. Bob signs p1=2: 2^7 mod 15 = 8
4. Bob signs p2=3: 3^7 mod 15 = 12
   - 8 is Bob's signature on 2
   - 12 is Bob's signature on 3
5. Eve computes the following:
   - 8^2 * 12^1 mod 15 = 3
   - We claim that 3 is a valid signature on M
6. Too show this we need to use RSA verifiction algorithm
   - S = 3; a valid signature
   - if S^e mod n = M, S is a valid signature on M
   - Compute 3^7 mod 15 = 12 *Verified!


#+END_EXAMPLE
******* Fermat's Factoring Method
******** See Sage:fermatAttack.sagews for example
******** Attack
		- Theorem (Fermat) Every odd integer (positive)
		  can be represented as difference of squares
		  - n=X^2-y^2 = (x-y)(x+y)
		- Fermat's attack is a deterministic factoring method
		  - not probabilistic?
		- Assume that n is RSA modlus. This means
		  - p=x-y and q=x+y
		  - p+q = 2x -> x=(p+q)/2
		  - q-p = 2y -> y=(q-p)/2
		  - n = x^2 - y^2 -> y^2=x^2 -n
			- y^2 >= 0 implies x^2 >= n  implies x >= sqrt(n)
		- Method
		  1. x= floor(sqrt(n))
		  2. check floor(x)^2 - n is a perfect square
			 1. if yes, we are done
				1. sqrt(floor(x)^2 -n)) = y
				2. floor(sqrt(n))=x
			 2. if not x->x+1
				1. x=floor(sqrt(n))+1
				2. Check whether floor(x)^2 - n is a perfect square
				   1. If yes we are done.
				   2. Otherwise x->x+1 and repeat
******** Defence
		- find p*q=n such that Fermat's factoring method is computationally difficult
		- Misc
		  - x=sqrt(n) +1
		  - x^2 - n = y^2
		  - (sqrt(n) + 1)^2 -n = y^2 (?)
		  - .
		  - .
		  - .
		  - (sqrt(n) + m)^2 - n = y^2

		- Defence against
		  1. If we have {p=x-y; q=x+y}, x=(p+q)/2, y=(q-p)/2
		  2. Using simple algebra...we get
			 - m=(sqrt(p) - sqrt(q))^2 /4
		  3. m is "small" if p~=q
		  4. DEFENSE: Choose p and q such that m is "large"
		
********* Example
********** TODO SAGE procedure on blackboard shows this defence
********** Misc
		  1. Assumee that after k many iterations we find
			 1. x=sqrt(n) +k and y=sqrt(x^2 -n)
******* Initial Segment Factoring Method
******** See Sage:ISattack.sagews for example
******** Defence:
		 1. Check whether n is weak against Fermat Attack
			- n i sresistant against Fermat Attack
		 2. Choose primes p and q such that p has some number of
			consecutive zeroes and choose q such that #q is alrger than
			the number of zeroes in p
		 3. Compute N=p*q
		 4. Apply IsAttack on N and Fermat Attack on N
****** Signatures
	   - Confidentiality
	   - Data integrity
	   - Authentication
	   - [[https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/nonrepudiation][Non-repudiation]]
		 - is the assurance that someone cannot deny something.
******* Define ownership of an RSA Key
		terse: signed with private key, verified with public key

		1. The key owner chooses two prime numbers, /p/ and /q/
		2. The key owner compute ~n=p*q~ and ~phi(n)=(p-1)*(q-1)~
		3. The key owner chooses an /e/ with ~gcd(e/phi(n))=1~
		   1. Compute ~e=t^-1 mod phi(n)~
		4. The key owner computes ~t=1/e mod phi(n)~
		
		[[./img/PhiEx.jpg][Whiteboard example]]
		
		The public signature key is ~(n,e)~ 
		The private signature key is ~t~

******* Verify Ownership
		- ~S=M^t mod n~
		  - S is a signature on M
		- ~k=S^e mod n~
		- If k=M, then the signature is valid

**** Structs
***** Notes
****** introduction

 A struct is a /class/ without any /methods/ (it only has /attributes/)

 There is more to structs than the above statement, we'll investigate this more.
****** Java comparison

 *KEY SIMILIARITIES*
  - A ~struct~ is a user-definied datatype (primitive c type
  - others...

 *KEY DIFFERENCES*
  - Syntax syntax syntax!
  - A ~struct~ has no methods
  - A ~struct~ has no constructors
  - A ~struct~ cannot inherit members from another ~struct~
  - Memory Management is different

****** Accessing Member Variables in a Struct

| Using a struct variable | Using a pointer vairable |
|-------------------------+--------------------------|
| purple.r = 255;         | pColor->r = 255;         |
| purple.g = 0;           | pColor->g = 0;           |
| purple.b = 255;         | pColor->b = 255;         |

****** Defining struct variables

#+BEGIN_SRC C
struct Color {
	unsigned char r;	//Red 0...255
	unsigned char g;	//Green 0...255
	unsigned char b;	//Blue 0...255
} purple, pink;			//Variables!!!
#+END_SRC
The above example defines a new data type, Color, and also defines two /uniinitialized/ 
color variables, purple and pink
****** Initializing a struct Variable

#+BEGIN_SRC C
struct Color {
	unsigned char r;	//Red 0...255
	unsigned char g;	//Green 0...255
	unsigned char b;	//Blue 0...255
} purple, pink;			//Variables!!!
struct Color purple = {255,0,255};
#+END_SRC
****** Struct Variable operators
	   - Assignment with "=" operator: purple = pink;
	   - Retrieve its address with "&": pColor = &purple;
	   - Accessing members with "." operator: int r = purple.r;
	   - Comparisons (e.g. "==") are *NOT* supported
****** Structs and Functions
	   - Struct variables (and everything in C) are /pass by value/
	    - ~struct Color chosenColor = selectColor(purple);
	   - Passses a _copy_ of the value of the struct purple to the selectColor func
****** Arrays of Structs
	   
struct Color primaries[8]; //An array of 8 Colors
primaries[0] = purple
***** Examples

 #+BEGIN_SRC C
 struct Place {
  int x;             //X-coodr of this Place
  int y;             //Y-coodr of this Place
  struct Place* next;//Address of next palce
 };
 .
 .
 .

 //Define a function to construct/initialize a new Place
 struct Place* newPlace(int xp, int yp){
     struct Place *p = malloc(sizeof(struct Place));
     //malloc - memory allocation
     p->x = xp;
     p->y = yp
     return p;
 }
 #+END_SRC

**** Malloc and Free
***** Notes

 malloc returns (void *)
 /this/ returns a reference to itself

 C lacks java's garbage collection service. you must explicitly /free/ everything
 you alllocate with /malloc/

 If you don't, you *will* /leak/ memory

***** Examples

 #+BEGIN_SRC C
 //Define a struct Place datatype
 struct Place{...};
 .
 .
 //Build an instance of a Place in memory
 struct Place* p = malloc(sizeof(struct Place));
 .
 .
 //Recycle the memory in the Place referenced by p
 free(p);
 #+END_SRC

**** Typedef
***** Notes
	  Basically just an alias to a datatype
***** Examples
	  ~typedef unsigned char unsbyte;~
	  ~typedef struct Color* pColor;~
	  the above definss unsbyte to be an alias for unsigned char
	  typedef does NOT define a new data type
	  this helps to write more readable code
**** Function Pointers

***** Notes
****** Abstractions
 *These abstractions can be implemented with simple Bitwise operations*
 1. Test Bit
	find what bit (?) is in a location
 2. Set Bit
	makes a bit a '1'
 3. Clear Bit
	makes a bit a '0'
 4. Toggle Bit
	1->0, 0->1
 5. Get Bit(s)
 6. Put Bit(s)

****** Mask/Inverse Mask
		- A mask is a filter that allows us to focus on BOI (Bit of Interest)
		- Values from some register we want to retrieve bits from, are copied into a mask register
		- Represent bits (example from book)
			- ldr r4, =0b00000000000000100000000000000000000 (not counted) //too lengthy
			- ldr r4, =0x00400000 //a little intuitive
			- ldr r4, =4194304 //unclear, don't use
			- ldr r4, =(1<<22) //intuitive which bit we are considering
		- *Mask* - all bits but the BOI are '0'
		- *Inverse mask* = all bits but the BOI are '1'
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE 
1 << 12
12: acts like the 'offset' for the data
0b111 << 12: sets bits 12, 13, and 14 to 1

#+END_EXAMPLE
****** Put and Get Bit
		+ Get Bit(s) - AND mask can get the BOIs
		+ Put Bit(s) - takes as input, a bit value (0 or 1). Takes value at runtime and puts into position
******* Normalize
******* De-Normalize
****** Normalize/Denormalize
	   Normalize - Shift bits /aligned right/
	   Denormalize - Shift bits to desired location

**** Mutator and Accessor
***** Definitions
| get | Accessor | function that retrieves a value from a private member variable                                                                |   |
|-----+----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---|
| set | Mutator  | a member function that stores a value in a private member variable, or changes its value in some way (setLength and setWidth) |   |

*IMPORTANT* Accessors do not change an object's data, so they
should be marked ~const~ (getLength and getWidth)

**** Predicates
***** WHERE
		Returns three options
		1. TRUE
		2. FALSE
		3. UNKNOWN
***** Logical Operators
	  + AND
		ex: 
#+BEGIN_SRC sql
SELECT * FROM Student
WHERE FIRSTNAME = 'Hope' OR LastName = 'Geller';
#+END_SRC
	  + OR
	  + NOT
***** Compariosn Operators
	  Used to check for comparative sameness between two expressions
	  (=,!=, <, >,<=,>=, LIKE)
***** LIKE
	   - The 'wildcard' in SQL is '%'
	   - Different than 'equality'. Checks for partial equality
	   - ex:
#+BEGIN_SRC sql
SELECT * FROM Student WHERE LastName LIKE 'S%';
#+END_SRC
***** ORDER BY
	  - orders information by (date, name, id, etc...)
#+BEGIN_SRC sql
SELECT *
FROM Class
ORDER BY Name ASC;	 
-- ORDER BY MaximumStudents, Name
-- ASC means ascending
-- DESC means descending
#+END_SRC
**** ALTER TABLE & FOREIGN KEY
***** Syntax
#+BEGIN_SRC sql
ALTER TABLE <tablename> ADD FOREIGN KEY (<columnname>)
REFERENCES <anothertable> (<columnname>)
#+END_SRC
**** Scalar Function
A function that takes zero or more parameters. It evaluates inputs and reutrns a result
 - Will return one value per record that it evaluates
 - Never changes stored data itself
 - Can be found in SELECT,INSERT, UPDATE,and DELETE queries

examples: CONCAT DATE_ADD LENGTH SUBSTRING NOW()

AS: creates an alias
SELECT CONCAT(FirstName, ' ', LastName) AS FullName, BirthDate
FROM Student
**** Procedure
***** Notes
	 - A database structure or construct that contains one or more sql queries
	 - Unlike functions, procedures can change data
***** Benefits
	  - Avoid duplicating database code
	  - Easier to tweak performance or behaviour in the database
	  - Can provide more security by limiting user access
	  - Encourages encapsulation
***** Examples
		
#+BEGIN_SRC sql
Delimiter $$
Create Procedure GetShortNameStudents()
BEGIN
	SELECT FirstName, LastName
	FROM Student
	WHERE LENGTH(FirstName) <= 5;
END;
$$

/*
	Use with:
CALL GetShortNameStudents();
*/

-- Another example
Delimiter $$
-- here I defined an input variable maxLength of type INT
Create Procedure GetSHortNameStudents2(IN maxLength INT)
BEGIN
	SELECT FirstName, LastName
	FROM Student
	WHERE LENGTH(FirstName) <= 5;
END;
$$
/*
	Use with:
CALL GetShortNameStudents2(6);
*/
#+END_SRC
**** Joining Tables
***** JOIN clause
	  - allows you to connect different sets of data
	  - you can have more than one JOIN clause and connect multiple sets together
	  - you can use LEFT or RIGHT joins, (INNER is an optional keyword and is
		default if no other keywords are present)
	  - Joining tables is often accomplished using a foreign key column that connects 
		to a primary key column in another table
	  - To connect Key columns you will use the ON clause after the JOIN clause

Assignments will build off of eachother,
use only one database for all assignments
